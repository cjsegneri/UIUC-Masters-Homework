### Data

The data used in this report is from the [Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey](https://www.google.com). I used the surveys from years 2015-2018 to chart the job satisfaction levels for the developers that participated in the surveys. The satisfaction level is on a scale of 0 to 10, 0 being hating their job, and 10 being loving their job.

### Messaging

I'm trying to show how many developers are satisfied with their jobs over time.

### Narrative Structure

My narrative visualization was designed to follow the interactive slide show. The user can select from the drop down to select the year in which to visualize the job satisfaction levels.

### Visual Structure

The visual structure for each scene is simple, and the transitions between each year display the scale of the bars to the user. The bars themselves are the main focus of the scene. The number of satisfactory jobs compared to unsatisfactory jobs can be clearly seen by comparing the height of the bars.

### Scenes

All of my scenes are bar charts that use the same job satisfaction level scale. The difference is the data that is used to populate the chart, as it differs by year. The scenes are ordered however the user wants to view them. They can choose the scene by selecting a year in the drop down at the top of the page. This gives the user control to jump around to whatever seen he/she chooses.

### Annotations

The annotations in this scene are the axis. They describe the scale of the developer count for each bar, and the satisfaction level each bar describes.

### Parameters

The parameters of the visualization are the years selected by the drop down menu. Based on the parameter selected, the developer data from that year is displayed.

### Triggers

Whenever a parameter is selected from the drop down menu, it triggers a transition to another scene, or another bar chart with the newly selected year's data. The drop down menu itself signifies to the user that this chart can be interacted with, and they have the option to trigger an alteration.
